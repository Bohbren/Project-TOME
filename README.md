Feel free to add any files from old project to here...


This project requires XAMMP to view. Clone this to your htdocs folder found in your xammp folder. After doing so start XAMMP and click start for both the Apache module and MySQL. Then click Admin for the Apache module and click on the folder containing the project. 

If you don't see a list of project folders you need to delete or rename the index file found in your htdocs folder.
